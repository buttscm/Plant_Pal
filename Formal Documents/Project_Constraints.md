# Project Constraints

## Social

Our project is designed for regular use by the general public. As an application that can be used to make taking care of their plant friend easier, it should easily increase their quality of life. Despite this design goal, this product and app will not be easily accessible by the general public, due to the need of the sensors, raspberry pi, and automatic watering mechanism. The sensors are easily purchasable, but the raspberry pi and watering mechanism are being custom made for this project, meaning we only have the one we plan to make for use, unless we want to make this into a larger scale project after completion.

## Environmental

You can only use our product if you have plants and soil nearby, and even then it is primarily designed for use with a small house plant that can easily be moved if needed. The app will notify the user if the plant has recieved enough sunlight or needs more of it. This is not something realistically feasible on an outdoor garden or anything of the sort. As well, if you include multiple plant species then the watering and sunlight levels might not be accurate for both plants.

## Technical

Our team consists of 3 computer science majors. For most of the project this is no issue, however when it comes to making the automatic watering mechanism we have little experience with hardware. Kevin is lucky enough to have some experience working with automated hardware, but even then the knowledge is limited. We will all need to do extra research to be sure that we can bring this idea to fruition.

## Time

Time should not be a major issue, but it is still just as important to account for. We have created a timeline to show what we'd *like* to have done at certain points, however making sure we can stick closely to this plan is important. All of us will be busy finishing out our last few courses for school, and juggling that alongside making sure we put all the required work into this project may make some obstacles pop up as the semester progresses.

# Summary of Hours

The first semester was primarily planning and documentation. Because of this, we as a team were all researching how best to approach our portions of the project taking care of the different documentation assignments together.

# First Semester

## Chris Butts
### 8 Hours (Documentation)
- Primary documentator for different assignments. Already had a handle on Android, so did not have too much planning to do aside from determining some communication methods. Because of this, for the first semester the small amount of time I spent doing work was for documentation.

## Kevin Eaton
### 6 Hours (Raspberry Pi Research)
- The Raspberry Pi component included not only figuring out the programming on the device, but also figuring out how to use the different hardware components required for the automatic watering device. A majority of the time spent this first semester was dedicated to this endeavor.
### 2 Hours (Documentation)
- Because Kevin spent most of the time researching for the Pi, tried to make him do less documentation to give him time to research.

## Raymond Gee
### 2 Hours (SQL Research)
- The SQL component, even in the early stages of development, was not going to be that difficult. Raymond spent his prior co-op experiences working in SQL as well, so figuring out how to handle this was not very difficult
### 4 Hours (Documentation)
- Since Raymond knew SQL more or less, I had him help out with documentation more often, drafting up design documents and the like.

Over the course of this project, during the second semester our team met every Thursday to go over what we each needed to get done, as well as working on things together, whether that be our individual components or combined efforts.

Giving a rough estimate for each of these meetings, we would all meet at a team member's home and work for 3 hours, minimum, and every two weeks we would send an update to our advisor. Looking through my sent mail, our group sent 5 updates, so using this to assume we had 10 meetings over the semester, so each of us will have a baseline 30 hours, just including the minimum possible meeting times.

# Second Semester

## Chris Butts
### 30 Hours (Meetings)
### 25 Hours (Android Application)
- At the start, the Android application was not much of an issue. However, once the communication compoennt came into play issues showed up. Originally the app was written in Kotlin, and when issues arrived with using communication libraries, the whole codebase had to be re-written in Java. From this point onward though it was relatively smooth sailing, and as time progressed smaller quality of life fixes were added as the end was reached.

## Kevin Eaton
### 30 Hours (Meetings)
### 15 Hours (Raspberry Pi)
- The Raspberry Pi took the most time to research to get the wiring and automatic watering portion working. Alongside the automatic watering, Python scripts also had to be written that would be called to write information the SQL datase to update the tables. 
### 4 Hours (WebScraper)
- To get the data off of our website we were using, we needed a webscrapper to get all of the information for us. Since Kevin was working with python already for the Pi, he handled making the web scraper.

## Raymond Gee
### 30 Hours (Meetings)
### 15 Hours (SQL Database)
- The SQL database was not the most difficult to set up, however issues were prevelent in the communicationn component of the app. Since the Android side of the application could not communicate properly using mySQL without web hosting, we shifting from hosting directly with mySQL to using XAMPP and PHP files. 


# Totals
## Chris Butts
### 63 Hours

## Kevin Eaton
### 57 Hours

## Raymond Gee
### 45 Hours

## OVERALL PROJECT HOURS
### 111 Hours
- If we count the meeting hours as only 30 hours individually, and all other hours seperately.

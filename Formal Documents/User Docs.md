# Initial Setup

## Setting up the Hardware

1. Assuming the Raspberry Pi already has the GPIO and sensors plugged in, please place the moisture sensor into the soil of your plant, and the sunlight sensor either into the soil or closeby the plant. This way, the Raspberry Pi will be able to read the plant's current moisture and sunlight levels.

2. The automatic watering device should be already hooked up to the Raspberry Pi. After assuring that the water tank is adequately filled with water, make sure the output tube for the water is properly positioned above the plant. This way the automatic watering device will release its water into the soil.

## Setting up the Software

1. Assuming the app has been downloaded, you will be prompted with a screen that looks something like this:

You will know that you've properly set up the sensors properly if you see values under the sunlight and moisture blocks of the app. However, this data will not be able to do much without knowing what kind of plant you have.

2. Press the "Change Plant" button and will be prompted with a dropdown menu of all the plants we currently have in the database. You will select the plant species you are using the app with, and the app will register this and gather the necessary information to know the proper thresholds for sunlight and moisture.

3. From here, your screen should look something like this:cd 

The app can now let you know if your sunlight or moisture levels are at proper levels. If they are not, there will be a small notice under the sunlight and moisture levels letting you know.

4. If you would like to set up automatic watering, you can click the gear in the top right corner. From here, you can turn on automatic watering for your plant.

# Common Questions

## "What if I don't know my plant's species?"
- If you don't know your plant's species, there is a default setting in the plant lookup. This will make sure the plant has moderate moisture and moderate sunlight. 

## "What if I have specific conditions I want my plant to be in?"
- In the settings menu, there is an option to manually set moisture and sunlight levels for your plant.

## "What if my plant Isn't in the database?"
- Similar to the above questions, you can either use the default setting in the database, or you can manually set your moisture and sunlight levels if you know these values for your plant. The plant could potentially be in the database under a different name as well, so it may be that you need to use the latin name of your plant to find it.

## "What if my plant is dying while using the app?"
- If your plant is dying under certain moisture and sunlight levels, please stop using the app. Your plant's health is much more important than the correctness of our database. If you still wish to use the app you can manually adjust the moisture and sunlight levels, and it may also be helpful to turn off automatic watering if you have that setting on.

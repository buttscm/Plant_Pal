# Planter's Guide Milestones

## SQL Database
### Expected Completion Date: February 1st, 2022

The completion of the SQL database means we have collected all of the data on the plants we intend to include and compiled it all into a comprehensive database. The database will be properly stored wherever we decide to host it, and it will function as we expect it to.

## Transfer Functionality
### Expected Completion Date: February 28th, 2022

At this point, we should be able to successfully have a user select a plant from our application. From here, that species will be sent to the raspberry pi, which will send a select to the SQL database. The database will then do the select as expected, return the data to the raspberry pi, and then send that data to the application to be utilized.

## App Functionality Completion
### Expected Completion Date: March 15th, 2022

The Planter's Guide app, at this point, should have all of its functionality completed. This includes notifying the user of plant and sunlight levels, letting the user know if they need to water or move their plant, etc. The UI of the app will still be incomplete at this point, but all of our desired functionality should be there.

## Automatic Watering Mechanism
### Expected Completion Date: April 1st, 2022

With this, the final major component of our project should be complete. The automatic watering mechanism should be able to recieve a signal from our raspberry pi, and then proceed to water the plant until it reaches an appropriate moisture level.

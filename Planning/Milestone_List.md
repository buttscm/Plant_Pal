# Planter's Guide Milestones

## Transfer Functionality
### Expected Completion Date: February 28th, 2022

At this point, we should be able to have data entered from the app (or a dummy app for testing). From here, this input should be transferred to the Raspberry Pi, send that data to SQL, have the output returned to the Raspberry Pi, and finally returned to the app. The Raspberry Pi should also be able to transfer data from the sensors to the app.

## SQL Database
### Expected Completion Date: March 15th, 2022

The completion of the SQL database means we have collected all of the data on the plants we intend to include and compiled it all into a comprehensive database. The database will be properly stored remotely as well as having some form of security to prevent anyone random from being able to edit the database.

## App Functionality Completion
### Expected Completion Date: April 1st, 2022

The Planter's Guide app, at this point, should have all of its functionality completed. This includes notifying the user of plant and sunlight levels, letting the user know if they need to water or move their plant, etc. The UI at this point should be complete, and if not in the final stages of development.

## Automatic Watering Mechanism
### Expected Completion Date: April 7th, 2022

With this, the final major component of our project should be complete. The automatic watering mechanism should be able to recieve a signal from our raspberry pi, and then proceed to water the plant until it reaches an appropriate moisture level. As well, during the watering process, the mechanism should not be overwatering the plant.

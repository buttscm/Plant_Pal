## Planter's Guide

### Main Points of Interest
* Utizing sensors & other hardware to gather data and automate processes
* Database management
* Image Processing

### Current Plan
Currently, our idea is to utilize moisture and sunlight sensors to be able to determine if a plant is in the correct conditions. Alongside an application,
we will allow the user to enter their plant species. The app will then communicate with our database to pull the optimal sun and moisture conditions for said plant.
If these levels are not at the correct levels, a notification will be sent to the user to let them know.

Potentially, we would like to add the following:
* A way to automatically water the plant if its moisture level falls too low.
* Allow the user to take a photo of the plant, and from this the app can automatically determine the species of the plant, and properly pull the data from our database.

More ideas may come up as we work on the project, and the image processing idea specifically will most likely be the most time consuming if we pursue it. We will update
this as the project progresses.
